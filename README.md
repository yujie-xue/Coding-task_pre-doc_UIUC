# Pre-Doctoral Data Analysis Task - UIUC

This repository contains the coding task for a pre-doctoral research position at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. It focuses on simulating and analyzing data to understand the impact of Facebook ad campaigns on COVID-19 vaccine uptake.

## Project Overview

The project involves a hypothetical field experiment where 5,000 participants across the US are exposed to two different types of Facebook ads - one appealing to reason and the other to emotions. The experiment aims to evaluate which strategy is more effective in increasing COVID-19 vaccine uptake.

## Repository Structure

- `Stimulation.ipynb`: Script for simulating the survey and assignment data.
- `Output.py`: Script for analyzing the simulated data, including logistic regression.
- `baseline_survey_data.csv` : Baseline Survey
- `random_assignment_data.csv`: Treatment Assignment
- `baseline_survey_data.csv`: Endline Survey
## Data Simulation

The simulation process involves:
- Generating baseline survey data with demographics and vaccine attitudes.
- Randomly assigning participants to one of three groups (reason ad, emotion ad, or control).
- Simulating endline survey data post-exposure to the ads.

## Installation and Usage

Clone the repository and install the required Python packages:

## bash
git clone https://github.com/yujie-xue/Coding-task_pre-doc_UIUC/
cd Coding-task_pre-doc_UIUC
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Analysis Approach
Use logistic regression to assess the effectiveness of each ad campaign strategy.
Conduct subgroup and sensitivity analyses for more in-depth insights.
Interpret the results in the context of public health messaging and campaign strategies.
## Results
The analysis aims to reveal:

## The overall effectiveness of the ad campaigns.
Differences in vaccine uptake based on demographics and ad strategy.
Insights into optimizing public health campaigns for vaccine promotion.
